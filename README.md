formme - create forms and store data for you static site
[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/b3791aa2-0011-4eb1-9b91-87b13fdaca1f/407828/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/halissonvit/formme)

The objective of the product is mainly for learning and training, and not to replace any of the good
solutions out there (<a href="https://formkeep.com/">formKeep</a>, <a href="http://pooleapp.com/">pooleApp</a>).
In fact, I am using PooleApp, and it is more than enough for my needs (a contact form on my jekyll site), and this
will have an impact on how the development will be driven. But I like the idea of develop this app, because it can
start very simple, and it will have enough implementation to apply a lot of what I want to study and to work with.

I have 3 main features in mind:

- Create an app to integrate with pooleApp and have a better visualization of the data

    PooleApp provides an api to create and fetch the data, using two different api keys. So for this I will need
        a way to setup my PooleApp visualization key. Also I want a better visualization then just the json.

- Allow the creation of forms independently of third party services

- Migrate the front-end of the app to use AngularJS, or other similar technology
